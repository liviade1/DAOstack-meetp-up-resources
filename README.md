## **Tech stack**

Are you a coder looking to build on the DAO stack or deploy your own DAO? These are all layers of the tech stack with their respective repos: 

**Arc**: Smart contract protocol for modular DAOs. https://github.com/daostack/arc

**Infra**: Protocol agnostic utility contracts for DAOs. https://github.com/daostack/infra

**Subgraph**: Caching layer for Arc DAOs. https://github.com/daostack/subgraph

**Client**: TypeScript client library for DAOified applications. https://github.com/daostack/client

**Alchemy**: Front-end for Arc DAOs. https://github.com/daostack/alchemy

In addition to this, there are other projects being built by other developer teams in the broader DAO ecosystem, such as dOrg https://dorg.tech/#/ 

**DAOcomponents:** React Component Library that makes integrating the Client library easier for application developers.https://github.com/dorgtech/daocomponents 

**DAOcreator:** Creation wizard for Arc DAOs https://github.com/dorgtech/daocreator

If you have any questions about the tech stack, the stack-support discord channel is the best place to go https://discordapp.com/channels/459281752326799380/555670522231521300 

Hackathons, working groups and other events that celebrate the open source community are also highly encouraged. Reach out to the ecosystem team if you would like support structuring an event. 

## **Narrative**

Narrative and curation are a huge challenge of our on-chain/of-chain communities. How can we onboard new members in the best way? How to incentivize permissionless cooperation? How to prevent collusion? Infinitely more questions could rise if we think about the culture we are inserted in and modifying together. That being said, any type of events that touch narrative and community are of great importance. Here is a list of some ideas of what you could do, but your creativity is the limit. 

**Book clubs** - organize an online or physical book club, with a subject of interest to the DAO ecosystem and report the collective insights to the community. 

**DAO residency** - Create an event that will bring creative minds together to design interactive solutions for the DAO space. 

**Curation collective**- Organize periodical or exporadical working groups to curate relevant information. Explore alternative mediums like zines, movies, theatre plays, collages, etc.

**Onboarding challenge** - Propose an event to onboard people from your non-crypto circles. What type of tools would you need? How would the improv go? 

The **DAOtalk** https://daotalk.org/ is the best place to access soft governance resources and keep up with important topics discussed in the community.
